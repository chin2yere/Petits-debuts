# Story:

It is a hard fact that most of the successful businesses we know and love today, started as on-campus business ideas. Several merchandise spanning major industries were mere ideas, ignited in the hearts of college students including software giants like Facebook, Google, Reddit, etc. However, the hurdles that these businesses have to overcome to simply exist on campuses are unnecessarily enormous. A mere look at the concept of these businesses on the surface level, and one would almost miss these hurdles, but if we are introduced to this concept from the point of view of a business owner, or a customer, we get to see the difficult side of successfully running these businesses.
I was fortunate enough to stumble on this side when I helped my friend manage her business last year; she was away at a conference. It was surprising how many issues they face.

1. Communication- The business-customer communication is scattered across several platforms. Because the businesses are trying to make themselves known, they utilize frequently visited platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, WhatsApp, GroupMe, etc. In return they are contacted by potential customers across these platforms. It gets especially challenging to keep track of conversations when they are not consolidated into one app.

2. Business-customer Proximity- Typically, a college student goes through their entire college life without knowing of the existence of a business that could have made their lives easier. Students usually hear about businesses through referrals or word of mouth. What happens to the students who do not typically move with the larger group? It is very difficult to reach potential customers unless they specifically come looking for you.

3. Advertisement and review system- Advertisement is very hard. People typically print flyers and paste them all around campus but these flyers either get ignored or taken down by school authorities. During the process of helping my friend run her business, I was kicked out of a GroupMe for trying to advertise her business online. People slide into the DMs of their peers to advertise themselves too, but this process is tiring and unnecessary. Also, there are some students who feed off reviews, be it spoken, or digital. The world has gotten so familiar with a rating system that most people choose not to operate without it. There is no way to rate campus businesses.

4. Double booking - In businesses that entail a service to be booked (for example hair and nails businesses), there is always a double booking problem. Two customers can request that service for the same time period, and it gets confusing for the business to find their way around that.

5. Accountability- it is very easy to cheat the businesses. Many of them do not operate on a contract basis, and as such, there have been several cases of people refusing to pay or finding other ways to defraud the business without being held accountable.

6. Expansion - On-camps businesses almost never expand. Firstly, there is no access to investors who could give them the financial wings to fly. A few businesses have tried to expand by joining popular e-commerce platforms, but they were met with membership fees, minimum product quotas and overshadowing, by already established businesses. Also, people with unconventional services that do not require a product like tutoring services, hair braiding and nail art, could not find a friendly e-commerce platform that would cater to their needs.
   With these hurdles, imagine the number of potential businesses that have perished, and did not make it to the real business world. We have possibly lost out on a number of business giants in our generation.
